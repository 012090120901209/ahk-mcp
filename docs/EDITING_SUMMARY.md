# File Editing System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What You Asked For
> "Duplicate the functionality of the Claude filesystem MCP's diff editing tools so it can edit the activeFilePath"

## What We Built

### üéØ Core Achievement
Created a comprehensive file editing system that works exactly like Claude's filesystem MCP, but specifically for AutoHotkey files using the shared `activeFilePath` variable.

### üîß Two Powerful Tools

#### 1. `AHK_File_Edit` - Swiss Army Knife Editor
- **Replace**: Text substitution with regex support
- **Insert**: Add content at specific lines
- **Delete**: Remove text or line ranges
- **Append**: Add to end of file
- **Prepend**: Add to beginning of file

#### 2. `AHK_File_Edit_Diff` - Git-Style Diff Patches
- **Unified Diff Parser**: Handles standard Git diff format
- **Patch Application**: Applies diffs with validation
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes without applying
- **Hunk Processing**: Multiple change sections in one diff

### üîÑ Integration with Active File System

**Seamless Integration:**
- Both tools automatically use `activeFile.activeFilePath`
- No need to specify file paths if active file is set
- Auto-backup creation before changes
- Only works with `.ahk` files for safety

**Smart File Detection:**
- Mention any `.ahk` path ‚Üí automatically becomes active
- All tools share the same variable
- Persistent until changed or cleared

### üìã Example Usage Flows

#### Flow 1: Simple Text Replace
```
1. User: "C:\Scripts\test.ahk - change 'Hello' to 'Hi'"
2. System: Sets activeFilePath = "C:\Scripts\test.ahk"
3. Tool: AHK_File_Edit with action "replace"
4. Result: File edited, backup created
```

#### Flow 2: Apply Git Diff
```
1. User: Pastes file path and diff patch
2. System: Detects path, sets as active
3. Tool: AHK_File_Edit_Diff with unified diff
4. Result: Patch applied with validation
```

#### Flow 3: Multiple Edits
```
1. File already active from previous operation
2. User: "Insert error handling at line 5"
3. Tool: AHK_File_Edit with action "insert"
4. Result: New code added at specified line
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

**Validation:**
- File existence checks
- `.ahk` extension enforcement
- Line number bounds checking
- Content matching for diffs

**Backup System:**
- Automatic `.bak` file creation
- Optional backup disable
- Preserves original before changes

**Error Handling:**
- Clear error messages
- Graceful failure modes
- Validation before modification

### üé® Advanced Capabilities

**Regex Support:**
```json
{
  "action": "replace",
  "search": "MsgBox\\(\"[^\"]*\"\\)",
  "content": "MsgBox(\"New message\")",
  "regex": true,
  "all": true
}
```

**Unified Diff Format:**
```diff
--- original.ahk
+++ modified.ahk
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 ; My Script
+#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0
 
 MsgBox("Hello")
```

**Dry Run Preview:**
```json
{
  "diff": "...",
  "dryRun": true
}
```

### üìä Technical Implementation

**Architecture:**
- Singleton pattern for shared state
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Error-first design patterns

**File Operations:**
- Async file I/O with proper error handling
- Atomic operations (read ‚Üí modify ‚Üí write)
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Cross-platform path handling

**Diff Engine:**
- Complete unified diff parser
- Hunk-by-hunk application
- Content validation before patching
- Support for multiple hunks per diff

## üöÄ Result

You now have **exactly the same capabilities** as Claude's filesystem MCP, but:
- ‚úÖ Works with AutoHotkey files specifically
- ‚úÖ Integrates with your shared `activeFilePath` variable
- ‚úÖ Includes both simple edits and advanced diff patches
- ‚úÖ Has comprehensive safety and validation
- ‚úÖ Provides clear feedback and error messages

### Ready to Use!
The system is built, compiled, and ready. Just mention a `.ahk` file path and start editing!
