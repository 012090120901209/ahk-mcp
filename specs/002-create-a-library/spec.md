## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

When a script developer wants to use UI Automation in their AutoHotkey script, they should be able to:
1. Discover that UIA.ahk library exists in the project
2. See documentation explaining what UIA provides and how to use it
3. Learn that UIA_Browser.ahk extends UIA and requires it as a dependency
4. Get example code showing how to import and use these libraries
5. Have the system check compatibility and warn about version mismatches
6. Import the libraries into their script with correct #Include statements

**Current State**: Libraries exist in scripts/ folder but are undocumented, hard to discover, and dependencies must be manually managed
**Desired State**: Centralized catalog with discovery, documentation, dependency tracking, and usage examples

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user wants to automate browser interactions
   **When** they query for available libraries
   **Then** the system MUST:
   - Show UIA_Browser.ahk in the library catalog
   - Display its description and capabilities
   - List UIA.ahk as a required dependency
   - Provide import instructions with correct #Include paths
   - Show example code for common browser automation tasks

2. **Given** a user imports a library with dependencies
   **When** the import is processed
   **Then** the system MUST:
   - Detect all transitive dependencies
   - Check if dependencies are available
   - Warn if any dependencies are missing
   - Provide the correct order for #Include statements
   - Validate version compatibility if versions are specified

3. **Given** a library has version information
   **When** a user checks compatibility
   **Then** the system MUST:
   - Compare required version against available version
   - Warn about version mismatches
   - Suggest compatible versions if available
   - Indicate breaking changes between versions

4. **Given** multiple libraries exist in scripts/ folder
   **When** a user lists available libraries
   **Then** the system MUST:
   - Scan scripts/ folder for .ahk files
   - Extract metadata from each file (classes, functions, dependencies)
   - Categorize libraries by purpose (UI automation, utilities, etc.)
   - Show documentation excerpts or summaries

5. **Given** a user wants to understand a library's API
   **When** they request library documentation
   **Then** the system MUST:
   - Extract classes, methods, and functions from the library
   - Show parameter information and return types
   - Display usage examples if available
   - Link to related libraries and dependencies

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a library has no version information?
  - System should treat as unversioned, warn user, suggest adding version metadata

- What happens when circular dependencies exist?
  - System must detect cycles and report error with dependency chain

- What happens when a library file is not valid AHK code?
  - System should skip it gracefully, log warning, continue processing other files

- What happens when dependency versions conflict?
  - System should report conflict, show which libraries require which versions, suggest resolution

- What happens when user requests a library that doesn't exist?
  - System should suggest similar library names (fuzzy matching), show available libraries

- What happens when scripts/ folder contains non-library files?
  - System should distinguish between libraries (reusable modules) and standalone scripts

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Existing scripts/ folder with AHK library files
- Existing MCP server infrastructure
- Existing AHK code analysis tools (AHK_Analyze)

### Assumptions
- Libraries follow AutoHotkey v2 syntax
- Libraries use standard #Include directive for dependencies
- Version information (if present) follows semantic versioning
- MCP clients (Claude) can process and display library documentation
- Developers have basic understanding of #Include mechanism

### Example Libraries (Initial Set)
1. **UIA.ahk** - UI Automation framework (no dependencies)
2. **UIA_Browser.ahk** - Browser automation (depends on UIA.ahk)
3. **Classes.ahk** - Utility classes (Cmd, Beep) - may have dependencies on ClipboardHistory, ToolTipEx
4. **ClipboardHistory.ahk** - Clipboard management (status unclear)
5. **ToolTipEx.ahk** - Enhanced tooltips (status unclear)

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Catalog coverage: 100% of .ahk files in scripts/ folder scanned
- Discovery time: <1 second to list all libraries
- Metadata extraction: 100% of classes and public functions documented
- Dependency resolution: 100% accuracy in dependency graph

### Qualitative
- Developers can discover libraries without manual folder browsing
- Import process is automated (no manual #Include path construction)
- Dependencies are automatically resolved
- Version conflicts are detected before runtime errors
- Documentation is accessible through MCP tools

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this feature:
- Package management (downloading external libraries)
- Library versioning system (git tags, releases)
- Library testing framework
- Automatic library updates
- Library publishing/distribution
- Code generation for new libraries
- Runtime dependency injection
- Library sandboxing or isolation

This feature focuses solely on managing and documenting the **existing** libraries in the scripts/ folder within the MCP server context.
