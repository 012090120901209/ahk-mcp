# AutoHotkey v2 MCP Server - Plain Language Summary

## What Is This?

The **AutoHotkey v2 MCP Server** is a specialized AI assistant tool that helps you write, analyze, and manage AutoHotkey v2 scripts. It connects to Claude (an AI assistant) through a standard protocol called MCP (Model Context Protocol), giving Claude powerful capabilities specifically designed for AutoHotkey development.

Think of it as a **smart coding companion** that understands AutoHotkey deeply and can help you:
- Write better code with intelligent suggestions
- Find and fix errors in your scripts
- Understand what your code does
- Run and test your scripts
- Manage files and libraries
- Learn AutoHotkey best practices

---

## How Does It Work?

When you ask Claude about AutoHotkey or ask it to help you write a script, here's what happens:

1. **You ask Claude**: "Create a clipboard manager in AutoHotkey v2"

2. **Claude uses this MCP server** to get context about:
   - What AutoHotkey functions and classes are available
   - What best practices and coding standards apply
   - How to properly structure AutoHotkey code
   - Real examples of similar AutoHotkey code

3. **Claude writes the code** with much better accuracy because it has access to:
   - Complete AutoHotkey v2 documentation
   - Your coding standards and patterns
   - Your active files and project context
   - Real-time analysis of code quality

4. **You run and test** the code Claude wrote using the built-in execution tools

## What Can It Actually Do?

The server provides **35+ specialized tools** organized into 5 categories:

### 1. **Code Analysis Tools** - Understand Your Code
These tools examine AutoHotkey code and explain what's happening:

- **AHK_Analyze**: Breaks down your script and lists all functions, variables, and classes it uses
- **AHK_Diagnostics**: Finds errors, syntax problems, and coding standard violations
- **AHK_LSP**: Provides language server protocol features (like an IDE)
- **AHK_VSCode_Problems**: Formats errors in VS Code compatible format
- **AHK_Summary**: Creates a quick overview of what your code does

**Example**: You paste a 200-line script, and it tells you "This script uses 15 functions, 23 variables, 2 classes, and has 3 potential bugs."

### 2. **Documentation & Learning Tools** - Learn AutoHotkey
These tools help you understand AutoHotkey's built-in capabilities:

- **AHK_Doc_Search**: Find documentation for any AutoHotkey function or class
- **AHK_Context_Injector**: Automatically inject relevant documentation into Claude's context based on what you're working on
- **AHK_Docs_Samples**: Show code examples of how to use specific features
- **AHK_Docs_Prompts**: Provide ready-made prompts for common AutoHotkey tasks
- **AHK_Memory_Context**: Remember your coding patterns and preferences

**Example**: You ask "How do I detect mouse clicks?" and it instantly shows you the `OnClick` method with working code examples.

### 3. **File Management Tools** - Handle Your Files
These tools help you work with AutoHotkey script files:

- **AHK_File_View**: Read and display the contents of any .ahk file
- **AHK_File_Edit**: Modify script files (add, remove, or replace code sections)
- **AHK_File_Create**: Create new .ahk script files
- **AHK_File_Detect**: Automatically find and detect .ahk files in your project
- **AHK_File_Recent**: List recently modified scripts
- **AHK_Active_File**: Track which file you're currently working on

**Example**: "Show me my main.ahk file" - it reads and displays it formatted and syntax-highlighted.

### 4. **Script Execution Tools** - Run & Test Your Code
These tools actually execute AutoHotkey scripts and show you the results:

- **AHK_Run**: Execute AutoHotkey scripts and capture output
- **AHK_Run_Debug**: Run scripts with debugger support for step-by-step execution
- **AHK_Test_Interactive**: Run scripts with GUI feedback (PASS/FAIL buttons)
- **AHK_Test_Analytics**: Track performance metrics and usage patterns

**Example**: You ask Claude to write a script, Claude creates it, and this tool runs it to verify it works before giving it to you.

### 5. **System & Configuration Tools** - Configure Everything
These tools help you manage the server itself:

- **AHK_Config**: Show current settings and configuration
- **AHK_System_Settings**: Enable/disable tools, configure behavior
- **AHK_System_Analytics**: Track which tools are used most and performance metrics
- **AHK_System_Alpha**: Test experimental features
- **AHK_Library_List**: Browse available code libraries

**Example**: "What tools are available?" or "Enable debug logging."

## Real-World Example: Building a Script with Claude + This Server

### Scenario: You want to create a "Window Finder" utility

**Step 1: You ask Claude**
```
Create an AutoHotkey v2 script that:
- Displays all open windows in a GUI
- Shows window titles and IDs
- Lets me click to bring a window to front
- Has a search box to filter windows
```

**Step 2: Claude uses the tools to gather context**
- **AHK_Doc_Search**: Looks up GUI creation, window detection, window control functions
- **AHK_Docs_Samples**: Gets code examples for creating GUIs and detecting windows
- **AHK_Context_Injector**: Gets your coding style and standards

**Step 3: Claude writes the script**
With all this context, Claude writes much better code than it could otherwise.

**Step 4: Claude uses AHK_File_Create**
Creates the script file in your project directory.

**Step 5: Claude uses AHK_Run**
Actually executes the script to test it.

**Step 6: You get working code**
A tested, working AutoHotkey v2 script that follows best practices.

## Key Features Explained

### 1. **Intelligent Context Awareness**
The server remembers which file you're working on and can use that context when analyzing or suggesting code. It's like having a coding partner who actually remembers what you're doing.

### 2. **Active File Tracking**
It knows which script is your "active file" - the one you're focused on. This means Claude can make suggestions specific to that file without you having to specify it.

### 3. **Built-in AutoHotkey Documentation**
Complete AutoHotkey v2 reference built in. When Claude needs to know about a function, it doesn't search the internet - it has the docs right there.

### 4. **Coding Standards Enforcement**
The server knows your coding standards and can check if your code follows them. It can also teach Claude to write code matching your style.

### 5. **Performance Analytics**
The server tracks which tools you use most, how long things take, and what patterns you follow. This helps optimize the server over time.

### 6. **Safe Code Editing**
When modifying files, the server makes changes safely:
- Backs up files before editing
- Can use "dry-run" mode to preview changes
- Supports atomic commits to git
- Can rollback if something goes wrong

### 7. **Window Detection**
For GUI scripts, the server can actually detect if your running script created windows and verify they work correctly.

## Common Questions

### Q: Does this replace AutoHotkey itself?
**A:** No! This is a helper tool for Claude. It doesn't run AutoHotkey scripts by itself - it just helps Claude understand AutoHotkey better and can execute scripts to test them.

### Q: Do I need to know how to use these tools directly?
**A:** No! You just talk to Claude normally. Claude automatically uses the right tools behind the scenes. You don't have to remember tool names or syntax.

### Q: What if Claude makes a mistake?
**A:** The tools include "dry-run" and preview modes so you can see what Claude wants to do before it actually does it. You can always reject changes or ask Claude to fix things.

### Q: Can I use this without Claude?
**A:** Technically yes, but it's designed for Claude. You could use it with other AI systems that support MCP protocol.

### Q: Does this work offline?
**A:** Yes! It runs on your computer. The AutoHotkey documentation is built in, so no internet required. You do need Claude (which requires internet), but the actual script analysis and execution happens locally.

### Q: How much does this cost?
**A:** The MCP server is free and open source. You only pay for Claude subscription if you use Claude.

## What Makes This Different?

Compared to asking Claude about AutoHotkey without this tool:

| Without MCP Server | With MCP Server |
|---|---|
| Claude has generic programming knowledge | Claude has AutoHotkey v2 specific knowledge |
| Claude can't actually run your code | Claude can run and test your scripts |
| Claude can't access your files safely | Claude can read/modify your files with backups |
| Claude might suggest AutoHotkey v1 patterns | Claude only suggests v2 patterns |
| No way to verify code works | Can verify scripts run correctly |
| Generic coding suggestions | Suggestions follow your coding standards |
