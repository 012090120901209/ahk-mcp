## Key Features Explained Simply

### Feature: Active File Context
**What**: The server remembers which file you're working on
**Why**: Claude can make suggestions specific to YOUR code
**Example**: You ask "improve this" and it knows which file without you saying

### Feature: Dry-Run Mode
**What**: Preview changes before they happen
**Why**: You can see what Claude wants to do and approve it first
**Example**: Claude says "I'll add this code. Here's what it looks like..." then waits for approval

### Feature: Built-in Backups
**What**: Automatic backup before any file change
**Why**: If something goes wrong, you can easily revert
**Example**: File modified, backup created, can rollback instantly

### Feature: Window Detection
**What**: Can verify if your GUI scripts actually create windows
**Why**: You know if your script works without manually running it
**Example**: Claude runs script, detects window, confirms "Your GUI loaded correctly"

### Feature: Analytics Tracking
**What**: Server tracks which tools are used most and how long they take
**Why**: Understand your workflow and optimize
**Example**: "You use analysis tools 60% of the time, file tools 30%"

## Comparison: Before vs. After Using This MCP

### Before (Without MCP Server):
```
You: "Write an AutoHotkey v2 script that..."
Claude: "Sure, let me write that"
  → Claude writes code without AutoHotkey knowledge
  → Code might use v1 syntax or wrong functions
  → You run it and get errors
  → You debug it yourself
  → You learn slowly
  → You fix issues manually
```

### After (With MCP Server):
```
You: "Write an AutoHotkey v2 script that..."
Claude: "Sure, let me gather AutoHotkey knowledge"
  → Claude searches built-in documentation
  → Claude gets code examples
  → Claude writes correct v2 code
  → Claude tests it automatically
  → Code works on first try
  → You learn from working examples
  → Issues caught automatically
```

## Real Example: Clipboard Manager

### What You Ask:
```
"Create a clipboard manager that:
- Monitors clipboard changes
- Saves history to a file
- Shows popup when something new is clipped
- Has a hotkey to show history"
```

### What The Server Does:
1. **AHK_Doc_Search**: Finds OnClipboardChanged function
2. **AHK_Docs_Samples**: Gets clipboard handling examples
3. **AHK_Docs_Samples**: Gets file I/O examples
4. **AHK_Context_Injector**: Gets GUI and hotkey patterns
5. Claude writes complete working code
6. **AHK_File_Create**: Saves the script

8. Shows you: "Your clipboard manager is ready! It works correctly."

### What You Get:
✅ Working code
✅ Tested and verified
✅ Follows best practices
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Documentation
✅ Ready to use
